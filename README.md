What inspired me to work
------------------------
Psychological issues, such as, depression, are one of the most common issues that people struggle and feel stress. 
I personally experienced the beginning of depression during the first year of Computer Science program. 
I was struggling with the course load, and not happy with my mark and it caused me depression.
However, I was able to solve depression by sharing my problem.
I believe that sharing problem with someone who is not related to the problem can help people to solve their problem.
